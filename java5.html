    <p>Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class (known as a subclass or child class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (referred to as a superclass or parent class). This mechanism promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Inheritance:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inheritance supports the concept of “is-a” relationship.</li>
        <li>It enhances code reusability and readability.</li>
        <li>Subclasses can add their own methods and variables in addition to the inherited ones.</li>
        <li>Subclasses can also override inherited methods to provide specific implementation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of Inheritance in Java:</h2>
    <p>Consider a base class <code>Vehicle</code> and a derived class <code>Car</code> that inherits from <code>Vehicle</code>:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
public class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;

    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Beep beep!");
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numberOfDoors;

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + ", Doors: " + numberOfDoors);
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, <code>Car</code> inherits from <code>Vehicle</code>. It means that <code>Car</code> can use the properties and methods of <code>Vehicle</code>, like the <code>brand</code> field and the <code>honk</code> method. The <code>Car</code> class also adds its own property (<code>numberOfDoors</code>) and method (<code>display</code>).</p>
