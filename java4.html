    <p>Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling the data (variables) and code (methods) that operates on the data into a single unit, known as an object. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.</p>

    <h2>Key Points of Encapsulation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring the class variables as private and providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables' values.</li>
        <li>This approach allows for controlled access to the data, as the class methods can enforce checks and balances on the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of Encapsulation in Java:</h2>
    <pre><code>
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int newAge) {
        if (newAge > 0) {
            age = newAge;
        }
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, the <code>Person</code> class has two private fields (<code>name</code> and <code>age</code>) and public methods to get and set these fields. This ensures that the fields cannot be directly accessed from outside the class, and all access is controlled through the methods.</p>
