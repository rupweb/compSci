    <h2>Regular Languages</h2>
    <p>Regular languages are a fundamental concept in the field of formal language theory and automata theory. They are a type of formal language that can be recognized and generated by regular expressions and finite automata. Regular languages are characterized by their simplicity and regularity in terms of their structure.</p>

    <h3>Key Characteristics of Regular Languages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular Expressions:</strong> Regular languages can be described using regular expressions, which are patterns that define sets of strings based on a specific syntax. Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and string manipulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Finite Automata:</strong> Regular languages can be recognized by finite automata, which are abstract machines with a finite number of states that can process input strings and determine whether they belong to the language.</li>
        <li><strong>Linearity:</strong> Regular languages exhibit linearity, meaning that the order of characters in a string matters, but there are no complex dependencies or structures within the language.</li>
        <li><strong>Concatenation, Union, and Kleene Star:</strong> Regular languages can be constructed through operations such as concatenation (joining two regular languages), union (combining two regular languages), and the Kleene star (repetition of a regular language zero or more times).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
    <p>Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are powerful tools for pattern matching and string manipulation. They are used in various programming languages and text processing tools to search, extract, and manipulate text based on specified patterns. Here are some key concepts related to regular expressions:</p>

    <h3>Components of Regular Expressions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Literals:</strong> Regular expressions can include literal characters that match themselves (e.g., the regex "cat" matches the string "cat").</li>
        <li><strong>Metacharacters:</strong> Metacharacters such as '.', '*', '+', '?', '|', '()', '[]', and '{}' are used to define more complex patterns. They have special meanings in regular expressions.</li>
        <li><strong>Character Classes:</strong> Character classes (e.g., [0-9]) allow you to match specific sets of characters. They are enclosed in square brackets.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> Quantifiers (e.g., '*', '+', '?') specify how many times a character or group of characters should be repeated.</li>
        <li><strong>Anchors:</strong> Anchors (e.g., '^' and '$') specify the start and end of a line or string, respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Groups and Capturing:</strong> Parentheses () are used to group characters and create subpatterns. They also allow for capturing matched text for later use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Use Cases for Regular Expressions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Regular expressions are used to validate user input, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Search:</strong> They are used in text editors and search engines to find specific patterns or words within documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Extraction:</strong> Regular expressions can be used to extract data from structured text, like log files or CSV files.</li>
        <li><strong>String Manipulation:</strong> They enable string manipulation operations like substitution and formatting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Regular languages and regular expressions are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. They provide a systematic way to describe and work with patterns in text and are widely used in various applications, from text processing to data validation and search operations.</p>
