    <title>The Builder Design Pattern in Java</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

<body>
    <p>The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations of the object.</p>

    <h2>Key Components:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Director:</strong> The director is responsible for orchestrating the construction process by using a builder.</li>
        <li><strong>Builder:</strong> The builder defines an interface for constructing parts of the object. It may include methods for setting various attributes or properties of the object.</li>
        <li><strong>Concrete Builder:</strong> Concrete builder classes implement the builder interface and provide specific implementations for constructing the object. Each concrete builder can create a different representation of the object.</li>
        <li><strong>Product:</strong> The product is the final object being constructed. It typically has a complex structure and is created using a builder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of the Builder Pattern:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> The pattern separates the construction logic from the representation, making the code more maintainable and flexible.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Builders can be reused to create different variations of the product without modifying the client code.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluent Interface:</strong> It allows for a fluent and readable construction process, with method chaining to set attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Object Creation:</strong> Useful when creating objects with numerous configuration options or optional parameters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Implementation:</h2>
    <pre><code>
// Product
class Pizza {
    private String crust;
    private String sauce;
    private String topping;

    public Pizza(String crust, String sauce, String topping) {
        this.crust = crust;
        this.sauce = sauce;
        this.topping = topping;
    }

    // Getters for attributes
    // ...
}

// Builder Interface
interface PizzaBuilder {
    Pizza build();
    PizzaBuilder setCrust(String crust);
    PizzaBuilder setSauce(String sauce);
    PizzaBuilder setTopping(String topping);
}

// Concrete Builder
class MargheritaPizzaBuilder implements PizzaBuilder {
    private String crust;
    private String sauce;
    private String topping;

    @Override
    public Pizza build() {
        return new Pizza(crust, sauce, topping);
    }

    @Override
    public PizzaBuilder setCrust(String crust) {
        this.crust = crust;
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    public PizzaBuilder setSauce(String sauce) {
        this.sauce = sauce;
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    public PizzaBuilder setTopping(String topping) {
        this.topping = topping;
        return this;
    }
}

// Director
class PizzaDirector {
    public Pizza createPizza(PizzaBuilder builder) {
        return builder
            .setCrust("Thin")
            .setSauce("Tomato")
            .setTopping("Cheese")
            .build();
    }
}

public class BuilderPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PizzaDirector director = new PizzaDirector();
        PizzaBuilder builder = new MargheritaPizzaBuilder();
        Pizza margheritaPizza = director.createPizza(builder);

        System.out.println("Margherita Pizza: " + margheritaPizza.toString());
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, we have a <strong>Pizza</strong> class as the product, a <strong>PizzaBuilder</strong> interface, and a <strong>MargheritaPizzaBuilder</strong> as a concrete builder. The <strong>PizzaDirector</strong> orchestrates the construction process, and we create a Margherita pizza using the builder pattern.</p>
