    <p>In Java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. It represents a single sequence of instructions that can be scheduled and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Threads are used to achieve concurrent execution, allowing multiple tasks to run in parallel and share system resources.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thread:</strong> A thread is an independent path of execution within a program. Java allows you to create and manage multiple threads to perform tasks concurrently.</li>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> A process is a separate program or application that runs independently. Each process has its own memory space and resources, and it can contain multiple threads of execution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Differences Between Threads and Processes:</h2>

            <td>A process is a standalone program with its own memory space.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Resource Sharing</td>
            <td>Threads within the same process share memory and resources.</td>
            <td>Processes have separate memory and resources, and they do not share with other processes by default.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Communication</td>
            <td>Threads within the same process can communicate easily using shared memory and objects.</td>
            <td>Processes typically use inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms for communication, which can be more complex.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Overhead</td>
            <td>Threads have lower overhead compared to processes because they share resources.</td>
            <td>Processes have higher overhead due to separate memory spaces and resource isolation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Creation</td>
            <td>Threads can be created within a process and share the process's resources.</td>
            <td>Processes are separate entities and must be created as separate programs.</td>
        </tr>

    <h2>Common Uses of Threads:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Multi-threading: Threads are used for multi-threading to achieve concurrent execution of tasks, such as handling user input, performing background tasks, or parallelizing computations.</li>
        <li>Responsive User Interfaces: Threads are used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to ensure that the user interface remains responsive while performing time-consuming tasks in the background.</li>
        <li>Server Applications: Threads are used in server applications to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, a custom thread class `MyThread` is created by extending the `Thread` class. The `run` method contains the code to be executed by the thread when it is started.</p>
