    <p>The time complexity of the Quicksort algorithm varies based on the scenario:</p>

    <h2>1. Best Case (O(n log n))</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the best-case scenario, the partition process divides the array into two equal halves.</li>
        <li>This results in a recurrence relation: T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + O(n).</li>
        <li>The solution to this recurrence relation is O(n log n).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Average Case (O(n log n))</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the average case, the partitions are not exactly equal but are reasonably balanced.</li>
        <li>The average-case complexity is also O(n log n), requiring more complex mathematical analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Worst Case (O(n^2))</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The worst-case scenario occurs when the partition process always picks the greatest or smallest element as the pivot.</li>
        <li>This results in one of the sub-arrays always being empty, leading to T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n).</li>
        <li>Solving this recurrence relation gives a complexity of O(n^2).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: The average case complexity is more representative of Quicksort's real-world performance, and strategies like choosing a random pivot are used to avoid the worst-case scenario.</p>
