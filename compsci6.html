    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>

    <h2>Four Main Principles of OOP</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
            <p>Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods. It helps in controlling the way data is accessed or modified.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Abstraction</h3>
            <p>Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and methods of the existing class, known as a superclass.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            <p>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It can be achieved through override (same method, different classes) and overload (same method, different parameters).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Benefits of OOP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Objects can be reused in different programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Pluggability and Debugging Ease:</strong> If a particular object turns out to be problematic, it can be removed and replaced with a different object with the same interface.</li>
    </ul>
