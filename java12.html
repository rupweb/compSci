    <p>In Java, both `HashSet` and `TreeSet` are implementations of the `Set` interface, used for storing a collection of unique elements. However, they differ in their internal data structures, ordering, and performance characteristics.</p>

    <h2>HashSet:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internal Data Structure:</strong> `HashSet` uses a hash table (or hash map) to store elements. Elements are stored based on their hash codes, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordering:</strong> `HashSet` does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The order of elements may vary and is not based on their natural order.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> `HashSet` provides fast average-case performance for basic operations like adding, removing, and checking for the existence of elements (O(1) on average).</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Use `HashSet` when you need a collection of unique elements and order does not matter. It is suitable for most cases where you need efficient set operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>TreeSet:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internal Data Structure:</strong> `TreeSet` uses a self-balancing binary search tree (usually a Red-Black Tree) to store elements. Elements are sorted based on their natural order or a provided comparator.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordering:</strong> `TreeSet` guarantees a specific order of elements, either in natural order (e.g., ascending for numbers) or a custom order specified by a comparator.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> `TreeSet` provides slower average-case performance for basic operations compared to `HashSet`. Basic operations are O(log n) on average due to the tree structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Use `TreeSet` when you need a collection of unique elements sorted in a specific order, such as maintaining a sorted set of elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
// HashSet Example
Set&lt;String&gt; hashSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
hashSet.add("Apple");
hashSet.add("Banana");
hashSet.add("Cherry");

// TreeSet Example (Natural Ordering)
Set&lt;String&gt; treeSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;();
treeSet.add("Apple");
treeSet.add("Banana");
treeSet.add("Cherry");
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, both `HashSet` and `TreeSet` are used to store a set of fruits. `HashSet` does not guarantee any specific order of elements, while `TreeSet` will maintain the elements in their natural order (lexicographically).</p>
