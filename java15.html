    <p>In Java, the <code>synchronized</code> keyword is used to create synchronized blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can access a particular block of code or method at a time. It is a fundamental tool for managing thread safety and preventing race conditions in multithreaded programs.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Ensuring that shared resources or critical sections of code can be accessed safely by multiple threads is essential to prevent data corruption and unpredictable behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Sections:</strong> These are code sections or methods where data is shared among multiple threads. Critical sections need to be protected to avoid conflicts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage of the synchronized Keyword:</h2>
    <p>The synchronized keyword can be applied in two ways:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Synchronized Blocks:</strong> You can use synchronized blocks to wrap a specific section of code to ensure that only one thread can execute that block at a time.</li>
        <pre><code>
synchronized (lockObject) {
    // Synchronized code block
    // Only one thread can execute this block at a time
    // Access shared resources safely here
}
        </code></pre>

        <li><strong>Synchronized Methods:</strong> You can declare entire methods as synchronized, which means that only one thread can execute the method on the same instance at a time. This is useful for ensuring that multiple threads don't interfere with each other when accessing object methods.</li>
        <pre><code>
public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
    // Synchronized method
    // Only one thread can execute this method at a time
    // Access shared resources safely here
}
        </code></pre>
    </ol>

    <h2>Benefits of Using synchronized:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> synchronized blocks and methods prevent race conditions and ensure that shared resources are accessed safely by multiple threads.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordered Execution:</strong> synchronized code blocks or methods are executed in a well-defined order, ensuring predictable behavior in multithreaded programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Preventing Deadlocks:</strong> Proper use of synchronized can help avoid deadlock situations where threads block each other indefinitely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
public class SynchronizedExample {
    private int sharedCounter = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void incrementCounter() {
        sharedCounter++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronizedExample example = new SynchronizedExample();

        // Create multiple threads that increment the shared counter
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                example.incrementCounter();
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                example.incrementCounter();
            }
        });

        // Start the threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            // Wait for both threads to finish
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Print the final value of the shared counter
        System.out.println("Shared Counter: " + example.sharedCounter);
    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, a class <code>SynchronizedExample</code> contains a shared counter and a synchronized method <code>incrementCounter()</code>. Two threads, <code>thread1</code> and <code>thread2</code>, increment the shared counter concurrently. The <code>synchronized</code> keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the <code>incrementCounter()</code> method at a time, preventing data corruption.

        After starting both threads and waiting for them to finish using <code>join()</code>, the final value of the shared counter is printed. The use of <code>synchronized</code> ensures that the counter is incremented safely, and the final result is consistent.</p>
