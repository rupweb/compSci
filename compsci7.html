<body>
    <p>Version control is a critical tool in the software development process. It involves managing changes to source code over time and plays a vital role in the success of software projects.</p>

    <h2>Key Benefits of Version Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Track Changes</h3>
            <p>Version control systems allow developers to keep track of every modification made in the code. If a mistake is made, developers can compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to other team members.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Version control systems enable multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously. Without version control, team members are prone to overwriting each other's changes. With version control, edits are merged, ensuring that parallel work is harmonized.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Backup</h3>
            <p>Version control systems serve as a backup of the codebase. They allow developers to revert the codebase to a previous stable state in case of a major problem.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Branching and Merging</h3>
            <p>Branching allows multiple versions of software to be developed in parallel, enhancing the development process. Merging enables these different branches to be combined back into a single branch.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular Version Control Systems</h2>
    <p>Some popular version control systems include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Subversion (SVN)</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Version control is indispensable in modern software development. It not only helps in managing the code for large teams but also provides a historical context, facilitates backup and recovery, and supports branching and merging strategies for concurrent feature development.</p>
