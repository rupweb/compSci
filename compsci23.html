<body>
    <p>Decidability and computability are two fundamental concepts in the field of theoretical computer science, and they are often used to describe the limits and capabilities of computational systems. However, they refer to different aspects of computation:</p>

    <h2>Decidability</h2>
    <p>Decidability is a property that relates to whether it is possible to determine a specific property or answer a question about a given input within a computational system. In other words, decidability is concerned with whether there exists an algorithm or procedure that can provide a definitive "yes" or "no" answer to a particular problem or question.</p>

    <h3>Key Points about Decidability:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Decidability is often associated with problems or languages that can be recognized by a Turing machine or any equivalent computational model.</li>
        <li>A problem or language is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can decide whether any given input belongs to it.</li>
        <li>Decidability is related to the concept of halting, i.e., determining whether a given algorithm will halt or run forever on a particular input.</li>
        <li>Many practical problems, such as checking whether a number is prime or determining the validity of a mathematical statement, are decidable.</li>
        <li>Decidability is about determining whether a solution exists and being able to verify it in a finite amount of time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Computability</h2>
    <p>Computability, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the ability of a computational system to solve a particular class of problems or perform computations in general. It is concerned with whether a computational system, such as a Turing machine, can compute a function or solve a problem for all possible inputs within its domain.</p>

    <h3>Key Points about Computability:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Computability addresses the general question of whether a particular problem or function can be computed by a computational system, without necessarily providing a definitive "yes" or "no" answer for every input.</li>
        <li>Problems that are computable may not be decidable if there is no guarantee of halting for all possible inputs.</li>
        <li>Alan Turing's concept of a Turing machine and the Church-Turing thesis played a pivotal role in defining computability and the limits of what can be computed algorithmically.</li>
        <li>Undecidable problems, such as the halting problem, are computable in the sense that they can be encoded as algorithms, but they may not have a definitive answer for all inputs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In summary, decidability pertains to the ability to determine whether a specific question or property is true or false for a given input, with a guarantee of halting. Computability, on the other hand, focuses on the broader question of whether a computational system can compute a particular function or solve a problem in general, without necessarily providing a definitive answer for all inputs. Both concepts are central to understanding the limits and possibilities of computation in theoretical computer science.</p>
